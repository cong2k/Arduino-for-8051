This header file is used for Arduino similar programming for 8051/8052 microcontrollers that allow easy
and arduino style programming, but it will increase code size & may affect efficiency. Not recommended
for timing critical applications or applications that require extremely fast program execution.

This is open source software. Feel free to share/edit/improve/fork it.
